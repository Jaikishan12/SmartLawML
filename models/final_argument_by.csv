"Moreover, it appears that impugned suicide note has seized by Investigating officer.",PREMISE

"Thus, prima facie, there is sufficient material on record to show involvement of present applicant/accused in the alleged commission of offence.",CONCLUSION
"Moreover, as per police report, it seems that applicant/accused is absconding since occurrence of offence.",PREMISE
"Moreover, it appears that if applicant/accused is released on bail, there is possibility that he will tamper the prosecution evidence.",PREMISE
"Supra cases on which, learned advocate for applicant/accused is relied are not applicable to the facts and circumstance in the case in hand.",PREMISE
"In the case in hand, in suicide note, there is specific allegations against present applicant/accused about they have threatened to kill to deceased, therefore, supra cases are not applicable to the case in hand.",PREMISE

As a result of which victim became pregnant.,CONCLUSION
3] According to applicant he is falsely implicated in this case.,PREMISE
There is delay in lodging report.,PREMISE
"During period since 01/08/2017 till 11/04/2018, victim never complained to anyone.",PREMISE

Victim became pregnant and delivered baby boy on 18.12.2018.,PREMISE
"Subsequently, with the consent of parents of both applicant and victim their marriage was performed on 21.12.2018.",PREMISE
First anticipatory bail was rejected as investigation was going on.,PREMISE
But now due to subsequent development custodial interrogation with applicant is not required and there is no possibility of giving threat and pressure by applicant to victim.,PREMISE
Family members of applicant are depending on him.,PREMISE
"Applicant is resident of Hadapsar, Pune and has no criminal antecedents.",PREMISE
"Due to levelling of offences punishable under section 376(2) (i), 376(2)(n) of the Indian Penal Code and under section 4,8 of POCSO Act there is apprehension in his mind about the arrest.",PREMISE
"So, he prayed to grant protection under section 438 of Code of Criminal Procedure.",CONCLUSION

Investigation in this matter is going on.,PREMISE
Due to delivery of child medical examination taking DNA samples are the procedural investigation part.,PREMISE
"In such circumstances and considering possibility of tampering prosecution evidence, it is not proper to grant interim protection to the applicant.",PREMISE
There is nothing on the record at present to show love affair between victim and applicant.,PREMISE
"Per contra, she narrated to her father about forcible sexual intercourse by applicant to her.",PREMISE
"Due to all above reasons, application deserves to be rejected with following order ­",CONCLUSION
[2] Perused the application and say given at Exh.10.,PREMISE
[3] Her learned advocate Mr. Deokar for the applicants and APP Mr. Aurangabadkar for the State.,PREMISE
"[4] The learned advocate Mr. Deokar for the applicants argued that the accused are falsely implicated in the present crime just because initially applicant no.1 had filed one report with police against the deceased, informant and his family members for the offence under section 306 of IPC, when his daughter committed suicide.",PREMISE
"He argued that the sessions trial is pending in the Sessions Court at Pune and now after the suicide of present informant's son, false complaint is filed on the same line against the present applicants.",PREMISE
"He argued that if the allegations in FIR are perused, the offence under section 306 of IPC is not made out.",PREMISE
There is no need of custodial interrogation of the accused.,PREMISE
"One co­accused is already arrested by the police and on the very first day of his production before Judicial Magistrate First Class, the accused was taken in MCR by holding ythat there was no need of custodial interrogation and said order is not challenged by police in the revision.",PREMISE
"He submitted that the applicants are law abiding citizens, having no criminal antecedents and they are ready to abide conditions if imposed.",PREMISE

The custodial interrogation of the applicants is needed.,PREMISE
He prayed for rejection of the anticipatory bail application.,CONCLUSION
[6] I have gone through the investigation papers produced by learned APP for my perusal.,PREMISE
"Prima­facie, it is clear from the averments in the FIR that deceased Ananta and late Amruta, the daughter of present applicant No.1 were having love relations and their marriage could not be solemnized and Amruta had committed suicide.",PREMISE
"Thereafter, present applicant no.1 had filed report against the family members of informant and crime came to be registered and sessions trial is pending.",PREMISE
"The learned advocate Mr. Deokar for the accused by referring the FIR registered on the report of applicant No.1 in the year 2013 argued that in the year 2013, the present applicant no.1 had alleged that the present informant Dilip Kamble did not consent for the marriage and he insulted deceased Amruta and, therefore, Amruta committed suicide.",PREMISE
"Now, in the present FIR, informant Dilip alleged that it was applicant no.1 who refused to consent for the marriage.",PREMISE
This is nothing but an attempt to book the applicants in false case.,PREMISE
"[7] The learned advocate Mr. Deokar submitted that without admitting the allegations, even if it is assumed for a moment that applicants alleged to have taunted deceased Ananta and demanded Rs. 5 lakh for withdrawing the allegations in sessions case, it cannot be said that it was done with intention to induce Ananta to commit suicide.",PREMISE
"According to the learned advocate, prima­facie the ingredients of Section 306 of IPC are not attracted.",CONCLUSION
"[8] The learned advocate for the applicants also referred the copy of first remand of arrested accused Haribhavu Bhagat and the order passed on it and argued that on very first production of the accused, the learned JMFC did not find that there is need of custodial interrogation of the applicants and remanded the arrested accused to judicial custody and the said order is not challenged, which is sufficient to indicate that the custodial interrogation of any of the accused is not required.",PREMISE
"[9] Having regard to the allegations made in the FIR against the accused / applicants, the fact that there was another case registered against the informant and his family members on the basis of report given by the present applicant No.1 for the offence under section 306 of IPC, the averments in that FIR, I find that the custodial interrogation of the present applicants is not necessary.",PREMISE
"Further, having regard to the allegations made in the FIR, the nature of the crime alleged, prima­facie I find that there is no specific role attributed to any of the applicants.",PREMISE
"Further, admittedly there are no criminal antecedents against the accused.",PREMISE
"Therefore, I find that the applicants in the present case are entitled for the anticipatory bail.",CONCLUSION
"Hence, I pass the following order.",CONCLUSION
[2] Perused the application and say given by respondent at Exh.3.,PREMISE
[3] Heard learned advocate Mr. Deokar for the applicant and APP Mr. Aurangabadkar for the State.,PREMISE
[4] The learned advocate Mr. Deokar for the applicant argued that the accused is falsely implicated in the present crime just because his brother had filed similar type of complaint against the informant and his family members when applicant's niece committed suicide.,PREMISE
"He further argued that from the FIR, prima­ facie it is not made out that accused abetted deceased Ananta to commit suicide.",PREMISE
"Admittedly, the applicant is Police­Patil and he has no criminal antecedents.",PREMISE
There is no likelihood of his getting absconded as he is permanent resident of Pune.,PREMISE
He prayed for release of accused on bail.,CONCLUSION
"[5] Per­contra, learned APP argued that the offence in question is serious in nature.",PREMISE
Having regard to the fact that accused / applicant is Police Patil and he is influential person and the possibility cannot be ruled out that he may tamper with the prosecution evidence.,PREMISE
He prayed for rejection of the application.,CONCLUSION
"[6] I have carefully gone through the FIR in the present crime and also the copy of the FIR registered by Haveli police station in the year 2013, in which the present informant and his family members are arrayed as accused for the offence under section 306 of the IPC.",PREMISE
"Admittedly, the present applicant / accused when was produced before JMFC on the first date of his production, was taken in judicial custody and the police machinery has not challenged the said order, it cannot be said that accused / applicant did not co­operate in the investigation.",PREMISE
"Having regard to the totality of the allegations made in the FIR, the nature of the offence and the above discussed circumstances, I find that no purpose will be served by keeping the accused / applicant behind bar.",PREMISE
"So far as apprehension expressed by the learned APP regarding tampering with the evidence, the care of the same can be taken by imposing needful conditions and hence the following order.",CONCLUSION
"It is alleged that victim aged about 17 years lodged report that on 05.01.2019 applicant i.e. friend of her brother followed her when she was returning to house from college and told her that he likes her and loves her, he thereby outraged her modesty.",PREMISE

He is ready to abide the conditions.,PREMISE
"Hence, he prayed to release him on bail.",CONCLUSION
4] APP objected this application on the ground that investigation is in progress.,PREMISE
"Applicant and victim are residing in same locality, so applicant will pressurize victim and witnesses.",PREMISE
There is possibility of tampering prosecution evidence.,PREMISE
"So, they prayed to reject the application.",CONCLUSION
5] Allegations against the applicant are serious.,PREMISE
Applicant is interrogated.,PREMISE
Considering allegations and nature of offence investigation is practically over.,PREMISE
Personal custody of applicant is not required.,PREMISE
"Applicant is resident of Shukrawar Peth, Pune.",PREMISE
Applicant is student and his career is spoil if he remained in jail for unknown period.,PREMISE

No purpose would serve by keeping the applicant behind bar for unknown period.,CONCLUSION
Due to all above reasons application deserves to be allowed with following order ­,CONCLUSION
"2] Applicant submits that, his wife approached to Chinchwad Police Station and thereby there is every likelihood that, police may register offence punishable under Sections 498­A and 406 read with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code against him.",PREMISE
He has received phone calls from the police.,PREMISE
"Therefore, he is having genuine apprehension.",PREMISE

"[5] After hearing the Ld. Counsel for the applicants, there is reasonable apprehension in the mind of the applicants about their arrest at the hands of non­applicant.",PREMISE
"Hence, as settled position of Law, the Applicants are entitled for ad­interim Anticipatory bail till filing of reply by the Opponent.",CONCLUSION
"Hence, following order :­",CONCLUSION
"Prosecution case is that on 15/12/2018 at about 12.30 a.m. to 01 a.m., when complainant was taking dinner at Punyai Lunch Home, present applicant/accused and other co­accused assaulted on him with deadly weapon,with intent to commit his murder and caused grievous injuries.",PREMISE
Learned counsel for the applicant/accused submitted that applicant/accused has not committed any offence and he has been falsely implicated in this offence.,PREMISE
"He further submitted that in the FIR, there is allegation against the applicant/accused about he assaulted on victim by kicks and fists only, therefore, considering role played by applicant/accused, he be released on bail.",PREMISE
"On the other hand, learned APP submitted that present applicant/accused along with other co­accused, formed unlawful assembly and in prosecution of common object of said assembly,assaulted victim with deadly weapon, with intent to commit his murder.",PREMISE
"He further submitted that at this stage, role of the applicant/accused cannot be separated.",PREMISE
"He further submitted that blood stains clothes is seized from applicant/accused, which shows his involvement in the alleged commission of offence, therefore, his bail application be rejected.",CONCLUSION
"On perusing police papers, prima facie, it reveals that at about 6­16 a.m. on the basis of report lodged by injured Vishal Amrale, a Crime No.346/2018 came to be registered at Bibwewadi Police Station against present applicant/accused and other co­ accused.",PREMISE
"Moreover, in the FIR, it is alleged that on the count of previous quarrel, present applicant/accused and other co­accused have assaulted on victim.",PREMISE
"Moreover, in the FIR, it is alleged co­ accused­Ritesh and Aniket have assaulted on victim with sickle, and present applicant gave kicks and fists blow to victim.",PREMISE
"Moreover, it seems that Investigating officer has seized blood stains clothes of presnt applicant/accused.",PREMISE
"Injuryh certificate shows that on 15/12/2018, injured­Tushaar was admitted in Bharati Vidhyapeeth hospital with history of assault by unknown persons, and he has sustained injuries to his both hands and head etc.",PREMISE
"So far as role played by present applicant/accused is concerned, he gave only kicks and fist blows to the victim.",PREMISE
"Moreover, it appears that nothing is remained to be seized from the custody of the applicant/accused.",PREMISE
"Moreover, custodial interrogation of the applicant/accused is now not necessary.",PREMISE
"Therefore, considering all these aspects, in my view if present applicant­accused is released on bail on certain conditions, no prejudice will be caused to the prosecution.",CONCLUSION
"Hence, I pass the following order.",CONCLUSION
"The learned Counsel for the applicant has vehemently submitted that the offence under Section 304 (II) does not attract, however, learned Magistrate while rejecting the bail application erroneously observed that and directed the I.O. to add this Section.",PREMISE
Rest Sections are bailable.,PREMISE
"Since beginning the applicant is cooperating I.O., hence he deserves bail.",CONCLUSION
"On the contrary, learned Counsel for the complainant and AGP have submitted that soon after the accident, the applicant fled away, instead of referring the victims to hospital.",PREMISE
"Thus, his role is attributed from FIR.",CONCLUSION
"On going through FIR, it is conspicuous that on 26.12.2018 at 12.30 midnight, the informant accompanied with another pillion rider was travelling by two wheeler being driven by Areik.",PREMISE
"Near Arnold School, Adarshnagar, Vadgaonsheri, one four wheeler came from opposite direction and rammed on to scooter,.",PREMISE
"In that accident, duo sustained head injuries, a four wheeler did not stop, somebody referred them to Sahyadri Hospital and thereafter to Ruby Hospital, where duo were declared dead.",PREMISE
"Initially, offence under Section 304 A with allied sections of IPC and Motor Vehicles Act, however, when the accused was produced before Magistrate, on its own the Magistrate has added offence under Section 304(II) of IPC, by observing that accused had knowledge of consequences.",PREMISE
"There is no material on record that the accused was aware how much injuries were sustained by the victims and in ordinary course, they were sufficient to cause death.",PREMISE
It was just an accident.,PREMISE
"The only inaction on the part of the accused is that he could refer the victims to hospital, but he did not.",PREMISE
"For, the prosecution has charged by Section 132(a) of MV Act.",PREMISE
"Secondly, the applicant was apprehended on 04.01.2019 and since then he is behind bar.",PREMISE
"Between the period, maximum investigation could be completed.",PREMISE
"Thirdly, the applicant is professional interior designer, has no criminal antecedents, much less are not placed on record.",PREMISE
It is true that in the mishap two innocents have lost their lives.,PREMISE
"The FIR reveals that to some extent the deceased had invited peril, since there were two pillion riders.",PREMISE
"The possibility of losing balance soon after seeing another vehicle came from opposite direction at midnight or due to headlight thereof, cannot be ruled out.",PREMISE
"By detaining the applicant, no fruitful purpose could be served of prosecution, but to levy certain conditions would suffice the purpose.",PREMISE
"Considering nature of offence, the applicant has no criminal antecedents, is permanent resident of Pune, having own profession and maximum investigation is over, in my view applicant deserves conditional bail.",PREMISE
"Hence, the order :",CONCLUSION
[2] Perused the application and say given by respondent at Exh.6.,PREMISE
"Also, perused the written say and submissions filed by original complainant at Exh.12.",PREMISE
[3] The learned advocate Shri.Amodkumar for the applicants argued that accused are falsely implicated in the present crime.,PREMISE
"From the documents filed on record, it is clear that initially N.C. was filed against only two accused and subsequently delayed FIR is filed involving present accused / applicants.",PREMISE
There is delay in filing FIR.,PREMISE
These facts go to show that accused are falsely implicated in the present crime.,PREMISE
"The death of Dinkar was on 15.9.2018, but the FIR came to be filed on 4­1­2019 with extraordinary delay of three and half months and no proper explanation is coming on record.",PREMISE
The conduct of the complainant also shows that the FIR is filed just to harass the informant.,PREMISE
"If the police did not take cognizance immediately, then the informant could have moved to superior officers or could have filed the complaint in the court.",PREMISE
"In the complaint, Priyanka is unnecessary made party.",PREMISE
"Admittedly, there was matrimonial dispute.",PREMISE
"Therefore, possibility cannot be ruled out that accused are falsely implicated in the present crime by taking disadvantage of death of Dinkar.",CONCLUSION
The deceased had fallen on his own and the uncle and father of Priyanka had visited the hospital.,PREMISE
This shows their bonafides.,PREMISE
"He further argued that even if the allegations are taken to be true at this stage, the allegations are only against applicant Sanjay and applicant Chetan.",PREMISE
He further submitted that accused have no criminal antecedents.,PREMISE
"The offence under section 304 of IPC is not attracted and, therefore, the bail application maybe allowed and accused are ready to abide any condition.",PREMISE
"[4] While countering the argument, the learned advocate for the informant submitted that there is no delay in the FIR.",PREMISE
Initially N. C. was given against four persons and not against two persons as it is argued by the advocate of the applicants / accused.,PREMISE
"He further submitted that the detailed application was given to police on 05­09­2018, but police took no action.",PREMISE
"Then another application was given on 09­09­2018, but action was not taken by police.",PREMISE
The third application was given on 25­10­2018 and finally the application was given on 28­10­2018.,PREMISE
He has filed on record the copies of those applications.,PREMISE
He submitted that informant has continuously made efforts that police should take action on her application.,PREMISE
"Finally, after death of Dinkar and after getting opinion from the doctor regarding the cause of death, police took cognizance and registered FIR and for this delay, the informant cannot be blamed.",PREMISE
"He submitted that if we go through the allegations in the FIR, it is clear that accused / applicants had visited the house with intention to assault the husband of the informant and her son.",PREMISE
"Prima­facie, there is sufficient material to show the involvement of the applicants in the crime.",PREMISE
The offence in question is serious.,PREMISE
He prayed for rejection of the application.,CONCLUSION
"[5] The learned APP for police by adopting the arguments of Mr. Sinalkar, further argued that from the material on record, it is clear that accused had intention to assault the deceased and his son.",PREMISE
"On gathering all the circumstances, it can be inferred that accused / applicants had intention of assaulting the deceased and his son and not to settle the matter.",PREMISE
He prayed for rejection of the application.,CONCLUSION
[6] It was one of the arguments that offence under section 304 of the Indian Penal Code is not attracted.,PREMISE
"May be in the heat of moment, there was push and the deceased had fallen and the offence under section 304­A of the IPC is attracted.",PREMISE
I have gone through the FIR and the allegations made therein.,PREMISE
It is specifically alleged that applicant No.2 Arun and applicant No.4 Manoj rushed towards informant's son Dhanraj and assaulted him with kick and fist blows.,PREMISE
"When he shouted for help, deceased Dinkar tried to intervene.",PREMISE
That time accused / applicant Chetan gave kick blow on the abdomen of Dinkar and Dinkar had fallen on iron Sofa.,PREMISE
He started vomiting and felt giddiness.,PREMISE
That time accused / applicant No.1 Sanjay and accused / applicant No.3 Chetan again pushed deceased Dinkar on Sofa and Dinkar had fallen on iron handle of the Sofa and received injury to his head and became unconscious.,PREMISE
"Having regard to these allegations in the FIR and role attributed to each accused, prima­facie it is clear that accused / applicants had visited the house of informant with a plan.",PREMISE
"It is clear that it was not a single isolated push resulting into fall of deceased Dinkar, but in fact, Dinkar was assaulted and was pushed on iron Sofa.",PREMISE
"Dinkar was old person and because of the fall on iron rod, he received injury to his head and it is clear that subsequently he died due to head injury.",PREMISE
"Having regard to the role attributed to the each accused in the FIR, the nature of the crime and the gravity of the offence, I find that accused / applicants are not entitled for anticipatory bail.",PREMISE
"Hence, I pass the following order.",CONCLUSION
[2] Perused the application and say given by respondent at Exh.5.,PREMISE
[4] The learned advocate for the accused / applicant argued that the applicant is falsely implicated in the present crime just because she is daughter­in­law staying separate from the family because of the disputes between the husband and wife.,PREMISE
He argued that it is alleged that applicant's relatives had been to the house of accused and the alleged incident took place.,PREMISE
The FIR is silent about the presence of the accused / applicant at the time of incident.,PREMISE
The applicant is falsely implicated in the crime.,PREMISE
She has no criminal antecedents.,PREMISE
The custodial interrogation of the applicant is not necessary and she is ready to abide any condition if imposed.,PREMISE
She prayed for bail.,CONCLUSION
[5] Here I may note that another Criminal Bail Application No. 156/2019 arising out of the same crime is also pending for hearing with this case and in that case learned advocate Shri.,PREMISE
Sinalkar appeared through the informant opposing the anticipatory bail application of other co­accused.,PREMISE
"Sinalkar has not put his appearance in the present case, at Bar he fairly conceded that so far as applicant / accused Priyanka is concerned, she is not connected with the crime.",PREMISE
"[6] The learned APP Mr. Aurangabadkar for State fairly submitted that after going through the FIR, it appears that the applicant / accused Priyanka was not present at the time of incident.",PREMISE
"But, he submitted that the possibility that accused shared common intention with other co­accused cannot be ruled out.",PREMISE
He prayed for rejection of the application.,CONCLUSION
[7] I have gone through the FIR.,PREMISE
"It is clear from the FIR that at the time of incident, applicant Priyanka was not present at the spot of incident.",PREMISE
Only her name is appearing in the concluding part of the FIR.,PREMISE
"So, having regard to the allegations in the FIR and the arguments for the parties, I pass the following order.",CONCLUSION
"The learned Counsel for the applicant has submitted that since only two accused are apprehended from the scene of offence, no offence of rioting is made out.",PREMISE
"The applicant is in custody since 23.12.2018 between the period, investigation against two accused is completed, final report is furnished against them, warranting no custodial interrogation.",PREMISE
"Thus, the applicant deserves rule of parity.",CONCLUSION
"On the contrary, learned AGP submitted that the investigation is going on and identification parade is to be arranged.",PREMISE
"On going through record, it is conspicuous that on 06.08.2018 at about 2.30 a.m. informant had been to Railway Station.",PREMISE
He was telephoned by grandson of his aunt.,PREMISE
"While they were waiting for vehicle, one two­wheeler having two pillion riders arrived, one of them claimed Rs. 200/­ from the informant.",PREMISE
He ignored him.,PREMISE
Over which two of five ransacked the informant of cash amount and golden chain and fled away.,PREMISE
"Thus, there was involvement of trio unnamed assailants on public road.",CONCLUSION
Till date no identification parade seems to be scheduled.,PREMISE
"The learned Counsel for the applicant has relied upon pronouncement between Sanjay Chandra V/s. Central Bureau of Investigation Vinod Goenka V/s. Central Bureau of Investigation, Gautam Doshi V/s. Central Bureau of Investigation, Hari Nair V/s. Central Bureau of Investigation, Surendra Pipara V/s. Central Bureau of Investigation, AIR 2012 Supreme Court 830, wherein it is observed that the object of bail is generally to secure appearance of accused person at crime.",PREMISE
His object is neither punitive nor preventative.,PREMISE

2] Heard Ld. Counsel on behalf of applicant­accused and Ld. APP.,PREMISE
3] Prima­facie from record and submissions of Ld. Counsel on behalf of both parties it is found that informant Vinay Vivek Arhana and his father Vivek Arhana are running Rozary Education Society and they are partners of the said education society.,PREMISE
They had engaged Adv. Sagar Suryawanshi as their legal advisor for the work of their said education society and even for other legal advise including finance etc.,PREMISE

The informant purchased their land and mortgaged the same with Cosmos Bank.,PREMISE
"But, later on it is found that they are not owners of said land.",PREMISE

"But on enquiry, it is found that, they have forged the affidavit, documents and vakalatnama with signature of informant and thereby filed said false suit on the basis of forged documents.",PREMISE
Those false affidavits were notarized before the present applicant­accused and besides that applicant has no role in this crime.,PREMISE
"It is alleged that, the informant has never instructed to Adv. Sagar Suryawanshi for filing the said suit, nor he has executed affidavits before Notary.",PREMISE
"He has not signed vakilpatra, but, his all the signatures are forced on so many documents and the said suit was filed.",PREMISE
5] The applicant was arrested in this crime on 02.01.2019.,PREMISE
In any case the record prima­facie does not show the breach of trust or fraud of crores of rupees cash by the applicant.,PREMISE
"Now even though the property or documents of lacs or crores of rupees are involved in the suit, but prima­facie at the most the role of applicant is notrising of the affidavits and not more than that.",PREMISE
Now some of the documents are in the court.,PREMISE
The police failed to recover any document from applicant.,PREMISE
"Therefore, no purpose is going to be served by keeping the applicant behind the bar.",CONCLUSION

There is no iota of evidence against the applicant.,PREMISE
The custody of the applicant is not at all required for investigation.,PREMISE
5] It is specifically argued by learned counsel of applicant that applicant is innocent and he has not committed any offence as alleged and therefore he is entitled for the relief of ad interim anticipatory bail.,PREMISE
"6] On perusal of the copy of F.I.R., it appears that the complainant has made specific allegations that the applicant that he has kept forcible physical relations with her on the pretext of marriage and then refused for marriage.",PREMISE
Prima facie involvement of the applicant in the offence in question appears.,PREMISE
"7] Considering the allegations made in the F.I.R. and considering the gravity of the offence, it cannot be said that custodial interrogation of the applicant is not necessary.",PREMISE
"8] Considering these facts together, considering the allegations made in the F.I.R. and considering the nature and gravity of the offences alleged to have been committed by the applicant, I am of the view that this is not a fit case to grant ad interim anticipatory bail to the applicant.",PREMISE
"Hence, the following order :-",CONCLUSION
The learned Counsel for the applicant has submitted that the applicant is unnamed accused and 3 to 4 co­accused are released by learned JMFC.,PREMISE

5] The applicant was arrested on 31­10­18 and after police custody etc. he is in jail since then.,PREMISE
"Police have recovered Activa vehicle bearing No.MH­14­HC­8115, from the possession of the applicant.",PREMISE
The applicant is in jail since last more than two and half month and the Investigating officer has completed almost entire investigation.,PREMISE
No purpose is going to be served by keeping the applicant behind the bar.,PREMISE
"The police have stated that the applicant with other co­accused have created terror in the society, but, they have not brought specification thereof on record.",PREMISE
Some of other accused are already released on bail in this crime.,PREMISE
"Therefore, it would be just and proper to release the 2 O­ in BA No.167/19 CNR­ MHPU01-000641-2019 applicant on bail.",CONCLUSION
"Hence, the order.",CONCLUSION
[2] Perused the application and say filed by I.O. I have heard both the sides and perused the material placed on the record.,PREMISE
[3] It is alleged by the complainant Lahanu Bidgar that on 07.12.2018 at about 06.00 p.m. the applicants no. 1 and 2 along with other co­accused came on the agriculture land of the complainant and started to destroy the water pipe line and pump starter with stones.,PREMISE
The complainant and his son came at the spot of incident.,PREMISE
"At that time, all the accused abused and threatened the complainant.",PREMISE
"On these allegations, the applicants prosecuted.",CONCLUSION
"[4] The Ld. Counsel for Applicants stated that, the applicants are innocent and have not committed any offence.",PREMISE
"Prior to this, the accused filed police complaint against the complainant.",PREMISE
This complaint is nothing but a counter­blast to the complaint given by the applicants.,PREMISE
The custodial interrogation of the applicants is not necessary.,PREMISE
There is no specific role attributed against the applicants.,PREMISE
The ingredients of Section 327 of IPC is not attracted at all.,PREMISE
"Hence, prayed that, the applicants be released on anticipatory bail.",CONCLUSION
[5] Ld. APP for the State submitted that the I.O. want to seize the weapon used in the offence.,PREMISE
The I.O. want to interrogate the applicants in detail about the incident.,PREMISE
The custodial interrogation of the applicants is necessary for the purpose of fair investigation.,PREMISE
"Hence, prayed to reject the application.",CONCLUSION
"[6] After hearing both the sides, and perusing the material placed on record, it reveals that, the Applicants filed complaint against the informant and others before filing this complaint by the informant.",PREMISE
There is dispute in between applicants and informant on account of pipeline of the agricultural field.,PREMISE
All the alleged offences are triable by Court of Magistrate.,PREMISE
There is no specific role of the alleged applicants in the alleged crime.,PREMISE
Their custodial interrogation is not necessary.,PREMISE
They are ready to abide the conditions imposed by the Court and to co­operate the investigating agency.,PREMISE
"Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, there is no hurdle to release the applicants on anticipatory bail.",PREMISE
"Hence, following order",CONCLUSION
It is objected over tenability and antecedents.,PREMISE
Already the applicants are prosecuted in CR No. 101/2018.,PREMISE
"In investigation, the applicants were summoned, however they took it otherwise under the garb of apprehension.",PREMISE
"On going through record, it is conspicuous that on 15.09.2018, Jenis Das, landlady in detail had lodged an FIR, against all the accused, as to how they in furtherance of their common intention abused and outraged her modesty in public, video­graphed the said act and terrorized her in public.",PREMISE
No separate crime is registered against the applicants.,PREMISE
I am conscious that registration of crime is not sine­qua­non under Section 438 of Cr.P.C.,PREMISE
"However, circumstances around accusations levelled needs to be -2­ scanned properly to find out truth.",PREMISE
M.A. No. 4422/2018 was pleased to grant pre­arrest bail on condition that the applicants shall make themselves available for interrogation by Police Officer as and when required.,PREMISE
"Deliberately, the applicants have suppressed this above fact, since only page 1 and 3 of said order is annexed to exh.3.",PREMISE
"However, for curiosity, when I have verified the said order from PDF file from dais, then the above fact was revealed.",PREMISE
The said practice is sheerly deprecable on the part of practicing lawyer.,PREMISE
"Learned AGP for the respondent have submitted that the applicants were summoned for interrogation purpose, liberty of which was kept in tact by the order, however, only to pressurize the police machinery, the applicants have present endeavour.",PREMISE
"In view of above, I see the applicant is devoid of merits.",PREMISE
"Hence, the order :",CONCLUSION
"Prosecution case is that applicant/accused No1 was mediator of settlement of marriage of complainant's sister, and some dowry is remained to be paid to father­in­law of complainant's sister.",PREMISE
"Complainant­Shivaji @ Shiraj Janardan Bangar visited Pune, in order to drop his sister at Pune, at that time, applicant/accused Nos. 1 to 4 have assaulted him with sharp weapon­Katti and tommy, and they have also thrown chilly powder in the eyes of complainant, and snatched gold chain of 6 tolas and cash amount of Rs.85,000/­.",PREMISE

"He further submitted that at the relevant time of incident, applicants­accused were not present at the spot of incident, but they were at village Pargaon, District­ Beed.",PREMISE
"He further submitted that custodial interrogation of the applicants­ accused are not necessary, therefore, applicants­accused be released on anticipatory.",PREMISE
"Per contra, learned APP submitted that applicants­ accused in furtherance of their common intention, assaulted to complainant with deadly weapon, caused him grievous hurt and snatched his gold chain and Rs.85,000/­.",PREMISE
He further submitted that weapons were seized from the spot of incident.,PREMISE
"He further submitted that Adhar card, driving license and PAN card of accused Ganesh Avhad were found at the spot of incident.",PREMISE
"He further submitted that custodial interrogation of applicants­accused is necessary in order to seize car, by which, applicants­accused accused arrived at the spot of incident.",CONCLUSION
"On perusing police papers, prima facie, it reveals that on the basis of report lodged by complainant­ Shivaji Bangar, a crime No.369/2018 came to be registered against the applicants­accused Nos. 1 to 4 at Dighi Police Station.",PREMISE
"Moreover, in the FIR, it is alleged that at the relevant time of incident, applicants­accused Nos. 1 to 4 have assaulted to complainant with Katti and tommy, and snatched gold chain and cash amount of Rs.85,000/­ from the complainant.",PREMISE
"Moreover, MLC certificate issued by YCM hospital shows that injured­ Shivaji Bangar was admitted in the hospital with a history of assault on 28/12/2018 and he has caused blunt trauma over occipital region, back, back of neck, left arm, nose, abrasion over nose around and exposure of both eyes to chilly powder.",PREMISE
"Thus, at this stage, allegations in the FIR are corroborated by MLC certificate issued by YCM hospital.",PREMISE
"Learned counsel for applicants­accused submitted that Sarpanch of Group Grampanchayat, Pargaon issued certificate to show that at the relevant time of incident, applicant/accused No.1­ Ashroba Avhad was at village­ Pargaon, therefore, it was not possible for him to remain present at the time of incident, at Pune.",PREMISE
"However, it is pertinent to note that in the FIR, names of applicants/accused as assailants with their role is specifically mentioned.",PREMISE
"Moreover, allegations in the FIR are corroborated by MLC certificate issued by YCM hospital.",PREMISE
"Therefore, in such circumstances, contention of applicants­accused that they were not present at the spot of incident, is not acceptable.",CONCLUSION
"Moreover, it seems that custodial interrogation of the applicants­accused is necessary for further investigation.",PREMISE
"Therefore, in such circumstances, in my view, applicants­accused are not entitled to be released on anticipatory bail.",CONCLUSION
"Hence, I pass following order.",CONCLUSION

2] Heard Ld. Counsel on behalf of applicant­accused Shri.,PREMISE
Shahid Akhtar and Ld. APP Shri.,PREMISE
3] Prima­facie from record and submissions of Ld. Counsel on behalf of both parties it is found that informant Vinay Vivek Arhana and his father Vivek Arhana are running Rozary Education Society and they are partners of the said education society.,PREMISE
They had engaged Adv. Sagar Suryawanshi as their legal advisor for the work of their said education society and even for other legal advise including finance etc.,PREMISE
"He had compelled informant to make a facility agreement with his wife Sheetal Tejwani, which was later on cancelled.",PREMISE
They both have falsely represented to informant that they are owner of land S.No.,PREMISE
394/2 at Talegaon and convinced the informant to purchase the said land.,PREMISE
The informant purchased their land and mortgaged the same with Cosmos Bank.,PREMISE
"But, later on it is found that they are not owners of said land.",PREMISE

"In said suit, present applicant has filed her Vakalatnama and affidavit.",PREMISE
"But on enquiry, it is found that they have forged the affidavit, documents and vakalatnama with signature of informant and thereby filed said false suit on the basis of forged documents.",PREMISE
"The informant has never instructed present applicant and Adv. Sagar Suryawanshi for 2 O in BA No.42/19 CNR­MHPU01­000170­2019 filing the said suit, nor he has executed affidavits before Notary.",PREMISE
"He has not signed vakilpatra, but, his all the signatures are forced on so many documents and the said suit was filed.",PREMISE
5] The Ld. APP has brought to my notice that the applicant and others with force the signatures have filed say­ w.s. in the above numbered suit and thereby requested of grant for injunction in favour of plaintiff in that suit.,PREMISE
According to him crores of rupees transactions and documents have been forged by the applicant and other co­ accused.,PREMISE

In any case the record prima­facie does not show the breach of trust or fraud of crores of rupees cash by the applicant.,PREMISE
"Now even though the property or documents of lacs or crores of rupees are involved in the suit, but prima­facie at the most the role of applicant would be forgery of signatures on Vakilpatra, affidavit and other documents.",PREMISE
The some of the documents are in the court.,PREMISE
The police failed to recover any document from applicant during P.C.R. Therefore no purpose is going to be served by keeping the applicant behind the bar.,PREMISE

"By relying on the judgment of Hon'ble Bombay High Court in the case of Mahipati Bapu Bandgar Vs. State of Maharashtra, 2002 ALL MR (Cri) 565, he submitted that fact of absconding would not itself disentitle the accused to get the bail.",PREMISE

"502 argued that during intervening period, the investigating agency neither arrested the applicant nor took steps for issuing proclamation and, therefore, it cannot be said that accused was absconding.",PREMISE

"Injured police Ashok Nawale, Sachin Bhagwat, Balu Sawant and Patil and two home-guards were discharged from the hospital.",PREMISE
"Perusal of injury certificate, it appears that there are no chances of converting the offences in to grievous one.",PREMISE
Substantive investigation is already completed.,PREMISE
There is no any specific role has stated by the complainant against the accused.,PREMISE
It is not the case of the prosecution that there are many criminal antecedents pending against the accused.,PREMISE
I am of the opinion that pertaining to the present applicant accused substantive investigation is already completed.,PREMISE
"Therefore, considering the nature of offence, applicant can be released on bail by imposing certain terms and conditions.",CONCLUSION
With this I proceed to pass the following order.,CONCLUSION
"2] It is the case of prosecution that, 22/09/2018 accused nos.1 and 2 have been arrested by the police of Anti­Narcotic Cell in Kondhwa Police Station in CR no.821/2018 for possessing 2 Kg.",PREMISE
174 Gram Ganja along with mobile hand set of Samsung Make and cash amount.,PREMISE
"Hence, on the complaint of Pravin Shirke, API of Anti­Narcotic Cell, Pune, this offence was registered.",PREMISE
"3] Advocate for the applicant in his argument stated that if the total quantity of seized Ganja is divided into two accused, the quantity of Ganja allegedly possessed by each accused is more than small quantity but less than commercial quantity.",PREMISE
"Therefore, bar under section 37 of NDPS Act is not attracted.",PREMISE
"In this context, reliance is placeed on unreported judgment of Bombay High Court in Cri.",PREMISE
"Investigation almost completed, only CA report is awaited.",PREMISE
"Therefore, further detention of the applicant is not necessary.",PREMISE
"Hence, she may be relesaed on bail.",CONCLUSION
4] Ld. APP strongly opposed this application.,PREMISE
It is his contention that investigation is not yet completed.,PREMISE
Offence is serious.,PREMISE
It is committed against soceity.,PREMISE
That stock of Ganja was found possesed with an intention to sell it.,PREMISE
"If this applicant will be released on bail, she will flee away from justice and there is possibility of tampering the prosecution witnesses and evidence.",PREMISE
"Hence, this application may be rejected.",CONCLUSION
"5] In above stated unreported judgment of Hon'ble High Court Bench at Aurangabad, the quantity of Ganja involved in that case was 10.572 kg.",PREMISE
"Therefore, Hon'ble High Court observed that it is less than commercial quantity, therefore, there is no bar under section 37 of NDPS Act.",PREMISE
"Hence, Hon'ble High Court released the applicant on bail.",PREMISE
"The ratio laid down in that case is squarely applicable to the present case as the quantity involved is less than commercial quantity, therefore there is no bar under section 37 of NDPS Act.",PREMISE
Custodial interrogation of the applicant is already over.,PREMISE
Further detention of the applicant is not necessary.,PREMISE
"Hence, I pass the following order.",CONCLUSION
"Prosecution case is that on 22/11/2018, original complainant­Umesh More lodged report with Anti­Corruption Bureau, Pune, alleging in that accused­Rohit Shende made demand of bribe amount of Rs. 2 crore, for getting decision from present applicant/accused­Dy.",PREMISE

"Moreover, as per prosecution case, present applicant/accused and arrested accused­Rohit Shende hatched conspiracy and accused­Rohit Shende was arrested while accepting bribe amount.",PREMISE
"Learned counsel for applicant/accused submitted that applicant­accused has not committed any offence, he has been falsely implicated in this crime.",PREMISE
"He further submitted that applicant/accused never met to Umesh More, never demanded amount of bribe to him.",PREMISE
"He further submitted that present applicant/accused was not present on scene of offence when ACB, Pune arrested to accused­Rohit Shende.",PREMISE
"He further submitted that Investigating officer has already 2 recorded statement of present applicant/accused, therefore, his custodial interrogation is not necessary.",PREMISE
"He further submitted applicant/accused has discharged his official duties relating to the case in­question and passed appropriate order on merit, therefore, no any investigation can be carried out against him without previous approval as required u/s. 17­A of Prevention of Corruption Act.",PREMISE
He further submitted that alleged telephonic conversations are much before incident and those cannot be considered as legal evidence to implicate applicant/accused.,PREMISE
Investigating officer with malafide intention added name of present applicant/accused in alleged crime without any sufficient evidence.,PREMISE
He further submitted that applicant/accused is suffering from heart disease and he was admitted in Sassoon hospital and thereafter to Jahangir Hospital in ICU.,PREMISE

Director of Land Records.,PREMISE
"He further submitted that during investigation , it is also disclosed that present applicant/accused asked Shri.",PREMISE
Dattatray Dawar to hand over copy of pending case to accused Rohit Shende before taking its entry in the Outward Register.,PREMISE
He further submitted that section 17­A of Prevention of Corruption Act is not applicable in this matter because this is case involving arrest on spot on charge of accepting and attempting to accept in undue advantage.,PREMISE
"He further submitted that section 17­A is applicable only in case, decision taken by public servant in discharge of official function or duties, but demand and accepting bribe amount not come in purview of discharge of official function and duties.",PREMISE
"He further submitted that custodial interrogation of applicant/accused is necessary to make enquiry with present applicant/accused about how copy of appeal received by arrested accused­Rohit Shende, and how much other persons are involved in the alleged commission of offence.",PREMISE
"On perusing police papers, prima facie, it reveals that on the basis of complaint dated 22/11/2018 lodged by Umesh More, after due verification, on 26/12/2018, raid was carried by ACB, Pune and caught accused­Rohit Shende while accepting bribe amount.",PREMISE

"Moreover, from the statement of Dattatray Dawar, who is working as Junior Clerk of Land Record office, Pune, it reveals that in CTS appeal No.4375/2018, arrested accused­Rohit Shende was not appointed as an Advocate by either party even though he was remaining present in that matter.",PREMISE
"Moreover, Dattatray Dawar in his statement stated that applicant/accused asked him to make discussion with arrested ­accused­Rohit Shende, in respect of impugned matter,and accordingly after 07­30 p.m., one person took him at the office of arrested accused­Rohit Shende, and made discussion about the said matter.",PREMISE
"Thus, from the statement of Dattatray Dawar, prima facie that arrested accused­Rohit Shende was not advocate of either party in impugned matter, but he was in contact with present applicant/accused.",PREMISE
"Moreover, it appears that before taking entry in Outward register, copy of pending work was handed over to accused ­Rohit Shende as per direction of present applicant­accused.",PREMISE
"Therefore, considering Call Detail Record collected by Investigating officer, prima facie it appears that though arrested accused­Rohit Shende is not appointed by either party in CTS appeal No.4375/2018, he was in contact with present applicant/accused.",CONCLUSION
"Moreover, as per prosecution case, arrested­accused­Rohit Shende accepted impugned bribe amount from the complainant as an agent of the present applicant/accused, this act on the part of applicant/accused not come within discharging official function or duties, therefore, section 17­A of the Prevention of Corruption Act is not attracted.",PREMISE
"Moreover, in the present case, prima facie, it reveals that applicant/accused is also invovled in the case, in which co­accused­Rohit Shende was arrested 5 on the spot while accepting bribe amount.",PREMISE
"Therefore, in such circumstances, mandate of previous sanction as per section 17­A of the Prevention of Corruption Act is not applicable to the facts and circumstances of case.",CONCLUSION
"Moreover, it appears that impugned investigation is at very crucial stage.",PREMISE
"It also appears that taking into consideration huge amount of bribe and gravity of offence interrogation of present applicant about how much officers of his department are involved in the alleged commission of offence, is necessary.",PREMISE
"Moreover, facts in case in hand and that of supra cases, on which learned advocate for applicant/accused is relied, are somewhat different.",PREMISE
"Therefore, observations of supra cases are not applicable to the facts and circumstances of the case in hand.",CONCLUSION
"Taking into consideration all above facts, in my view, applicant­accused is not entitled to release on anticipatory bail.",CONCLUSION

The marriage of applicant and deceased took place on 27-5-1990.,PREMISE
The presumption under section 113 or 114 is not applicable to the present case as marriage took place before 28 years.,PREMISE
"From the said wedlock, deceased got one son and one daughter.",PREMISE

Say of the prosecution nowhere reveals that further detention of the accused is necessary for further investigation.,PREMISE
Almost investigation 4 is completed.,PREMISE
"The apprehension of the prosecution is only that if he is released on bail, he will pressurize the prosecution witnesses and complainant.",PREMISE
The apprehension of the prosecution can be taken care of by imposing certain stringent conditions.,PREMISE
"Therefore, considering the nature of offence, I find that it is a fit case to exhaust the judicial discretion of bail.",CONCLUSION
"Therefore, it is just and desirable to release the accused on bail by imposing some stringent conditions.",CONCLUSION
"Hence, I proceed to pass the following order :",CONCLUSION
3] The learned Counsel for the applicants submitted that offence u/s. 436 does not attracted as no house is caused mischief by fire or by explosive substance.,PREMISE

5] Since the arrest of the applicant they are in jail.,PREMISE
Practically the investigation might had completed and charge sheet is yet to be filed.,PREMISE
"Therefore, in my view further custody of the applicant is not required.",PREMISE

"8] Considering these facts together, considering the allegations made in the F.I.R. and considering the nature and gravity of the offence alleged to have been committed by the applicant, the authorities cited on behalf of the accused are not helpful to him at this prima facie stage.",PREMISE
"Therefore, I am of the view that this is not a fit case to grant ad interim anticipatory bail to the applicant.",CONCLUSION
"Hence, the following order :-",CONCLUSION

So there was no recovery of scooter at the instance of the applicants / accused.,CONCLUSION

P. C. need of accused for conducting test identification parade is not ground for refusal of the bail if accused are otherwise found entitled for the bail.,PREMISE
The accused are not having any criminal antecedents and they are ready to abide conditions if imposed.,PREMISE
The practical investigation is done and there is no need to keep accused / applicants behind bars.,PREMISE
He prayed that the bail application may be allowed.,CONCLUSION
[5] The learned APP for respondent argued that the FIR is not expected to be encyclopedia giving all minute details.,PREMISE
The investigation is in progress.,PREMISE

"Therefore, it cannot be said that there is delay.",CONCLUSION
"He further submitted that in the FIR though involvement of less persons is alleged, during investigation it transpired that arrested accused along with two other persons hatched a criminal conspiracy and only because the informant was in car and he could manage to avoid the access of accused with him, the major crime did not occur and, therefore, police have applied Section 511 of IPC.",PREMISE

It has transpired that two other accused are involved in the commission of crime.,PREMISE
There was use of SIM cards registered in the name of other persons.,PREMISE

The involvement of the accused in the present crime is clear from the recording of the event by the camera installed in the car of the informant.,PREMISE
"He submitted that from the images recorded by the camera, it is clear that the vehicle used by the applicants / accused was Activa scooter and merely the investigating officer wrongly mentioned it as motorcycle, does not mean that there is difference in the vehicle, because from the recovery Panchanama under Section 27 of the Evidence Act, it is clear that Honda Activa two wheeler is recovered at the instance of the applicants  accused.",PREMISE
He submitted that the investigation is in progress.,PREMISE
The co­ accused are yet to be arrested.,PREMISE
"Having regard to the conspiracy hatched by the accused persons with absconding accused, if at this stage the applicants / accused are released on bail, it would adversely affect the investigation.",CONCLUSION
He prayed for rejection of the application.,CONCLUSION
[6] I have gone through the FIR and also the investigation papers produced before me for my perusal.,PREMISE
"Though prima­facie from the FIR, it appears to be the incident where two riders on the two wheeler stopped the car of the informant and threatened him and demanded money on the count of dash alleged to have been given to their two wheeler.",PREMISE
"From the investigation papers given for my perusal, it appears that two other persons are also involved in the crime and they four have hatched the conspiracy.",PREMISE
"[7] It is clear from the averments in the FIR that only because informant was advocate by profession, he could sense the gravity of the situation, he could avoid further uncalled events.",PREMISE
